# Week-1-Homework

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation was to complete this homework assignment to the best of my ability 
- I debugged this assignment to show myself what I need to work on outside of class. Debugging is definetly something I need to improve on 
- It solves buggy code and also provides efficiency 
- I learned that there is a lot left to learn when fixing code. 


## Installation

The steps that were required to install this project was to fix all the code and turn it more efficent by putting the code in semantic order. The next step was to make sure that when everything was fixed and ordered nicely everything should have proper title and alt attributes so that the webpage can match the examplary image that was provided to us. The last step was to deploy this assignment and that was the hardest part for me because I had forgotten all about deploying my homework which made it harder to relearn every step of deploying but thankfully I had assistance.
